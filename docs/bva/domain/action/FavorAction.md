# BVA Analysis for FavorAction

## Public interface for this class
- execute(gameState) → void

## Assumptions and notes
- PlayerInteractionHelper handles target selection (pickTarget) and card transfer (giveCard).
- FavorAction filters out the current player from the active players list before calling pickTarget.
- giveCard prompts the target player to choose a card to give; if the target has an empty hand, no card is transferred.
- If no other active players exist, an IllegalStateException is thrown.



### Method under test: `execute()`
spaces: number of other active players, target hand size

cases:
- no other active players: IllegalStateException
- one other player, empty hand: no card transferred
- one other player, one card: that card transferred to current player
- one other player, many cards: target-chosen card transferred
- multiple other players: selected player's chosen card transferred
- max size (N/A)
