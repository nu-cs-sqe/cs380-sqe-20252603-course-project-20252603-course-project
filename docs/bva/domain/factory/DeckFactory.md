# BVA Analysis for DeckFactory

## Public interface for this class
- buildDeck() --> Deck
- buildExplodingKittenCards() --> Card[]
- buildDefuseCards() --> Card[]

## Assumptions and notes:
- this class assumes the input (num players) to the constructor is validated by the caller of the class thus does not include that rule in this BVA.
- all card types (except exploding kittens) have fixed card numbers that are nto affected by any input (not even number of players)



### Method under test: `buildDeck()`
spaces: collection,

cases:
- low - x (N/A since we can trust the number comingin is validated by the caller of this class)
- low 2
- high 5
- high +x (N/A since we can trust the number coming is validated by the caller of this class)
- empty (N/A fixed return deck size)
- one element (N/A fixed return deck size)
- more than one (N/A fixed return deck size)
- max size (N/A fixed return deck size)
- duplicate elements (N/A fixed return deck size)
- most positive (N/A fixed return deck size)
- most negative (N/A fixed return deck size)
- most positive + 1 (N/A fixed return deck size)
- most negative -1 (N/A fixed return deck size)
