# BVA Analysis for Main

## Public interface (methods under analysis)

- `runGame(controller: GameController)` → void

## Assumptions and notes

- `runGame` calls `controller.startGame()` exactly once before the loop.
- The loop calls `controller.playATurn()` on each iteration and exits when `controller.isGameActive()` returns false.
- `main` is the composition root and is not under test; only `runGame` is tested.

---

### Method under test: `runGame()`

spaces: number of turns = { 0, 1, many }

cases:
- game is already inactive (zero turns played)
- game active for exactly one turn
- game active for multiple turns
