# BVA Analysis for ShuffleAction

## Public interface for this class
- execute(gameState) → void

## Assumptions and notes
- Deck shuffling is delegated entirely to GameState; the action does not inspect deck contents.



### Method under test: `execute()`
spaces: deck state (not inspected by this action)

cases:
- any deck state: shuffleDeck() is called
- empty deck (N/A — shuffle on empty deck is valid and handled by Deck)
