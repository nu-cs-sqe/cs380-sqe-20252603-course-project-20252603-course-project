# GameModel BVA

`GameModel` coordinates the game state: it enforces phase rules, checks resource costs, delegates board
mutations to `BoardHandler`, and deducts resources from the current player.

### Constructor initial state: `GameModel(List<Player>, BoardHandler)`

|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|
| Test Case 1 | new model, one player     | getCurrentPhase() = BEFORE_ROLL | :white_check_mark: |

---

### Method under test: `performTurn(int roll)`

Transitions phase from `BEFORE_ROLL` to `GENERAL_PLAY` (non-7) or `MOVE_ROBBER` (7).
Throws `IllegalGamePhaseException` if called outside `BEFORE_ROLL`.

Step 1:

- Input: roll (int)
- State: current game phase
- Output: phase transitions to GENERAL_PLAY (roll ≠ 7) or MOVE_ROBBER (roll = 7)
- Output: exception when current phase is not BEFORE_ROLL

Step 2:

- roll: Interval [2, 12]; special value 7
- Game phase: BEFORE_ROLL (valid); any other (invalid)

Step 3:

- roll: 2 (LOW), 7 (robber trigger), 12 (HIGH)
- phase: BEFORE_ROLL (valid); GENERAL_PLAY (already rolled — invalid)

### Method under test: `endTurn()`

Advances to the next player and resets phase to `BEFORE_ROLL`. Throws `IllegalGamePhaseException`
if called outside `GENERAL_PLAY`.

Step 1:

- State: current game phase, player turn order
- Output: phase resets to BEFORE_ROLL; next player becomes current
- Output: exception when current phase is not GENERAL_PLAY

Step 2:

- Game phase: GENERAL_PLAY (valid); BEFORE_ROLL (invalid); MOVE_ROBBER (invalid)

Step 3:

- phase: GENERAL_PLAY; BEFORE_ROLL (invalid); MOVE_ROBBER (invalid)

### Method under test: `attemptBuildSettlement(nodeID)`

Cost: 1 brick + 1 grain + 1 lumber + 1 wool. Max 5 settlements per player.
Resource check iterates in enum ordinal order: BRICK → GRAIN → LUMBER → WOOL.

Step 1:

- Input: nodeID (board position)
- State: current game phase, settlement count, per-resource counts (brick, grain, lumber, wool)
- Output: settlement placed, resources deducted, decks replenished, settlement count incremented
- Output: exception

Step 2:

- nodeID: delegates validation to `BoardHandler`
- Game phase: Case {GENERAL_PLAY (allowed), any other (not allowed)}
- Settlement count: Interval [0, 5]; max = 5
- Per resource (brick, grain, lumber, wool): Interval [0, 19]; cost boundary = 1

Step 3:

- Game phase: GENERAL_PLAY; RESOURCE_PRODUCTION (representative invalid); BEFORE_ROLL
- Settlement count: 0 (LOW); 4 (HIGH−1); 5 (HIGH — exceeds max)
- Brick (first checked): 0 (below cost); 1 (at cost); 2 (surplus)
- Grain (second checked): 0 (below cost, brick already ≥ 1); 1 (at cost)
- Lumber (third checked): 0 (below cost, brick & grain already ≥ 1); 1 (at cost)
- Wool (fourth checked): 0 (below cost, brick/grain/lumber already ≥ 1); 1 (at cost)

### Method under test: `buyDevCard(DevelopmentCardDeck deck)`

Cost: 1 ORE + 1 WOOL + 1 GRAIN. Valid phase: GENERAL_PLAY only.
Resource check order (matching existing GameModel convention): ORE → WOOL → GRAIN.
The deck is drawn **after** resources are validated; resources are deducted only on a successful draw.
The ORE, WOOL, and GRAIN resource decks are replenished by 1 each on success.
Returns the drawn `DevelopmentCard`.

Step 1:

- Input: deck (DevelopmentCardDeck)
- State: current game phase, current player's ORE/WOOL/GRAIN counts, deck size
- Output: DevelopmentCard drawn; player's ORE/WOOL/GRAIN each decremented by 1; ORE/WOOL/GRAIN resource decks each replenished by 1; card added to player's hand
- Output: exception

Step 2:

- Game phase: Case {GENERAL_PLAY (allowed), others (not allowed)}
- Player ORE: Interval [0, 19]; cost boundary = 1
- Player WOOL: Interval [0, 19]; cost boundary = 1
- Player GRAIN: Interval [0, 19]; cost boundary = 1
- Deck size: Interval [0, 25]; boundary values: 0 (empty), 1 (last card), 25 (full)

Step 3:

- Game phase: GENERAL_PLAY; BEFORE_ROLL (invalid); MOVE_ROBBER (invalid)
- ORE (first checked): 0 (below cost); 1 (at cost boundary); 3 (surplus)
- WOOL (second checked): 0 (below cost, ORE already ≥ 1); 1 (at cost boundary)
- GRAIN (third checked): 0 (below cost, ORE/WOOL already ≥ 1); 1 (at cost boundary)
- Deck size: 0 (empty — EmptyDeckException after resource check passes); 1 (last card); 25 (full)

### Method under test: `handleLongestRoad()`

Handles checking and redistributing points based on longest road, to be called in building settlements and roads (things which can change longest road)

Inputs:
- currentLongestRoadColor -> RED, WHITE, ORANGE, BLUE
- Board state

Outputs:
- Cases -> BoardGraph result
  - PlayerColor.SETUP -> no one meets conditions for longest road
  - Same PlayerColor -> no change -> no victory points awarded
  - New PlayerColor -> change -> Victory Points Redistributed
