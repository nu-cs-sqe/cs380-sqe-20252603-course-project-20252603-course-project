# One Turn of the Game

The following methods cover one complete turn: the current player drafts reinforcement armies, optionally attacks, optionally fortifies, then ends their turn. These methods are all active during the `ATTACK` or `FORTIFY` phase.

**Turn flow:**
1. On entering `ATTACK` phase (after setup or after `endTurn()`), `getDraftArmies()` reports
   `max(3, floor(ownedTerritories / 3))` for the current player.
2. Player places all draft armies via `draftArmy()`.
3. Player may call `attack()` zero or more times only after all draft armies are placed.
4. Player calls `endAttack()` to transition to `FORTIFY`.
5. Player optionally calls `fortify()` once.
6. Player calls `endTurn()` to advance to the next player.

## Method: `int getDraftArmies()`

Returns the number of reinforcement armies the current player has remaining to place this turn.
At the start of each `ATTACK` turn, this equals `max(3, floor(ownedTerritories / 3))`.
Calling `getDraftArmies()` is informational only; it does not place armies and does not make
the draft complete. The returned value decrements as `draftArmy()` is called.

- **TC32: Draft armies for player owning 1 territory** ( :white_check_mark: )
    - **State of the system**:
        - phase: ATTACK, start of turn
        - current player owns 1 territory
    - **Expected output**:
        - returns 3 (minimum — floor(1/3) = 0, clamped to 3)
        - draft is not complete until all draft armies are placed with `draftArmy()`

- **TC33: Draft armies for player owning 11 territories** ( :white_check_mark: )
    - **State of the system**:
        - phase: ATTACK, start of turn
        - current player owns 11 territories
    - **Expected output**: 3 (floor(11/3) = 3, equal to minimum — last count that stays at 3)

- **TC34: Draft armies for player owning 12 territories** ( :white_check_mark: )
    - **State of the system**:
        - phase: ATTACK, start of turn
        - current player owns 12 territories
    - **Expected output**: 4 (floor(12/3) = 4 — first territory count that exceeds the minimum of 3)

- **TC35: Draft armies for player owning 42 territories** ( :white_check_mark: )
    - **State of the system**:
        - phase: ATTACK, start of turn
        - current player owns all 42 territories
    - **Expected output**: 14 (floor(42/3) = 14 — maximum possible)

## Method: `void draftArmy(TerritoryName territory)`

Places 1 draft army on a territory owned by the current player during the `ATTACK` phase.

- **TC36: Place draft army on owned territory** ( :white_check_mark: )
    - **State of the system**:
        - phase: ATTACK

        - draftArmiesRemaining = 3
    - **Expected output**:
        - ALASKA armies increase by 1
        - draftArmiesRemaining decreases to 2

- **TC37: Place last draft army** ( :white_check_mark: )

## Method: `void attack(TerritoryName from, TerritoryName to)`

Current player attacks an adjacent enemy territory using all armies available from the attacking territory while leaving 1 army behind. Dice are rolled internally until the defender is eliminated or the attacking territory has only 1 army left. If all defending armies are eliminated, the attacker captures the territory and may move armies into the captured territory.

# Multiple Turns

The following test cases cover behaviors that emerge only across more than one complete turn:
turn-order wrap-around, fresh draft state at the start of each new turn, the `GAME_OVER`
transition triggered when the final territory is captured, and the enforcement that no
further game actions are permitted once `GAME_OVER` is set.
