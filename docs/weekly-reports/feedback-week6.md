# Week 6 Project Feedback by PM/TA

**Dedicated PM/TA**: Utkarsh Narain (utkarshnarain2026@u.northwestern.edu)

## How to Read This Feedback
> [!NOTE]
> **Purpose.** This feedback focuses on your team's progress and collaboration. It is meant as guidance, not judgement.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Scope.** For the BVA and TDD items, the PM/TA evaluates only the `main` branch. Ongoing work in feature branches will be evaluated after it is merged. If you'd like early feedback on work in progress, please reach out to your PM/TA directly.

> [!TIP]
> **Mistakes are expected :).** As the instructor mentioned in class, early mistakes are part of the learning process. As long as your team addresses the issues after you get the feedback, your grade will not suffer from them.

## Checklist
Status:
- ✅: All done/Good job!

## Additional Comments
Good progress this week with solid design work including user stories and UML, which gives a strong base for implementation. The next step is to move into coding by building a simple playable turn in the game to start connecting the components together. Also make sure Checkstyle and SpotBugs are set up or tracked on the board soon to avoid last minute issues. Overall, the planning looks strong, now focus on turning it into working and integrated code.
