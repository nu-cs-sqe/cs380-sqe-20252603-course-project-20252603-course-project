## JavaFX
We have decided to use JavaFX as the core GUI engine for this project, because JavaFX is the modern successor of Swing and we're hoping to leverage its expanded feature set and more flexible support for styling and animations.

## Rule Exceptions
In our development of Catan, there were certain rules that were not implemented. For one, when a 7 is rolled, the player is not currently forced to discard any resources if their resource count is higher than 7. Similarly, players are not immediately granted resources when placing their second settlement. Finally, a player is not able to trade in four resources for any resource of their choosing, they must either trade with other players or own a port. To the best of our knowledge, all other rules of the game are implemented.
