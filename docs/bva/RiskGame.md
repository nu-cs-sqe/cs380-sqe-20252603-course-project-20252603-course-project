# One Turn of the Game

The following methods cover one complete turn: the current player drafts reinforcement armies, optionally attacks, optionally fortifies, then ends their turn. These methods are all active during the `ATTACK` or `FORTIFY` phase.

**Turn flow:**
1. On entering `ATTACK` phase (after setup or after `endTurn()`), `draftArmiesRemaining` is set to `max(3, floor(ownedTerritories / 3))`.
2. Player places all draft armies via `draftArmy()`.
3. Player may call `attack()` zero or more times.
4. Player calls `endAttack()` to transition to `FORTIFY`.
5. Player optionally calls `fortify()` once.
6. Player calls `endTurn()` to advance to the next player.

## Method: `int getDraftArmies()`

Returns the number of reinforcement armies the current player has remaining to place this turn. At the start of each `ATTACK` turn, this equals `max(3, floor(ownedTerritories / 3))` and decrements as `draftArmy()` is called.

- **TC32: Draft armies for player owning 1 territory** ( :white_check_mark: )
    - **State of the system**:
        - phase: ATTACK, start of turn
        - current player owns 1 territory
    - **Expected output**: 3 (minimum — floor(1/3) = 0, clamped to 3)

- **TC33: Draft armies for player owning 11 territories** ( :white_check_mark: )
    - **State of the system**:
        - phase: ATTACK, start of turn
        - current player owns 11 territories
    - **Expected output**: 3 (floor(11/3) = 3, equal to minimum — last count that stays at 3)

- **TC34: Draft armies for player owning 12 territories** ( :white_check_mark: )
    - **State of the system**:
        - phase: ATTACK, start of turn
        - current player owns 12 territories
    - **Expected output**: 4 (floor(12/3) = 4 — first territory count that exceeds the minimum of 3)

- **TC35: Draft armies for player owning 42 territories** ( :white_check_mark: )
    - **State of the system**:
        - phase: ATTACK, start of turn
        - current player owns all 42 territories
    - **Expected output**: 14 (floor(42/3) = 14 — maximum possible)

    - **State of the system**:
        - phase: ATTACK
