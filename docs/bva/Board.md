# BVA Analysis for `Board` Class

## Method under test: `initializeBoard()`

| Test Case ID | State of the System | Expected Output | Implemented? |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| BOARD-INIT-001 | A new empty board exists. `initializeBoard()` is called. | The board becomes an 8x8 chess board with all 32 pieces in their correct starting positions. | :x: |
| BOARD-INIT-002 | A board already has pieces on it. `initializeBoard()` is called again. | The board resets to the standard chess starting position with no leftover pieces from the previous state. | :x: |

## Method under test: `getPieceAt(int row, int col)`

| Test Case ID | State of the System | Expected Output | Implemented? |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| BOARD-GET-001 | Board is initialized. `getPieceAt(0, 0)` is called. | Returns Black rook. | :x: |
| BOARD-GET-002 | Board is initialized. `getPieceAt(0, 4)` is called. | Returns Black king. | :x: |
| BOARD-GET-003 | Board is initialized. `getPieceAt(7, 4)` is called. | Returns White king. | :x: |
| BOARD-GET-004 | Board is initialized. `getPieceAt(3, 3)` is called. | Returns `null` because the square is empty at the start. | :x: |
| BOARD-GET-005 | Board is initialized. `getPieceAt(-1, 0)` is called. | Throws an error or returns invalid result because row is below board boundary. | :x: |
| BOARD-GET-006 | Board is initialized. `getPieceAt(8, 0)` is called. | Throws an error or returns invalid result because row is above board boundary. | :x: |
| BOARD-GET-007 | Board is initialized. `getPieceAt(0, -1)` is called. | Throws an error or returns invalid result because column is below board boundary. | :x: |
| BOARD-GET-008 | Board is initialized. `getPieceAt(0, 8)` is called. | Throws an error or returns invalid result because column is above board boundary. | :x: |

## Method under test: `isWithinBounds(int row, int col)`

| Test Case ID | State of the System | Expected Output | Implemented? |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| BOARD-BOUNDS-001 | Board exists. `isWithinBounds(0, 0)` is called. | Returns `true`. | :x: |
| BOARD-BOUNDS-002 | Board exists. `isWithinBounds(7, 7)` is called. | Returns `true`. | :x: |
| BOARD-BOUNDS-003 | Board exists. `isWithinBounds(-1, 0)` is called. | Returns `false`. | :x: |
| BOARD-BOUNDS-004 | Board exists. `isWithinBounds(8, 0)` is called. | Returns `false`. | :x: |
| BOARD-BOUNDS-005 | Board exists. `isWithinBounds(0, -1)` is called. | Returns `false`. | :x: |
| BOARD-BOUNDS-006 | Board exists. `isWithinBounds(0, 8)` is called. | Returns `false`. | :x: |

## Method under test: `movePiece(int startRow, int startCol, int endRow, int endCol)`

| Test Case ID | State of the System | Expected Output | Implemented? |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| BOARD-MOVE-001 | Board is initialized. White pawn is at `(6, 0)`. `movePiece(6, 0, 5, 0)` is called. | Pawn moves one square forward. Starting square becomes empty and ending square contains the White pawn. | :x: |
| BOARD-MOVE-002 | Board is initialized. White pawn is at `(6, 0)`. `movePiece(6, 0, 4, 0)` is called. | Pawn moves two squares forward because it is the pawn's first move. | :x: |
| BOARD-MOVE-003 | Board is initialized. White pawn is at `(6, 0)`. `movePiece(6, 0, 3, 0)` is called. | Move is rejected because a pawn cannot move three squares. | :x: |
| BOARD-MOVE-004 | Board is initialized. Empty square at `(3, 3)`. `movePiece(3, 3, 4, 3)` is called. | Move is rejected because there is no piece at the starting square. | :x: |
| BOARD-MOVE-005 | Board is initialized. `movePiece(-1, 0, 0, 0)` is called. | Move is rejected because the starting row is outside the board. | :x: |
| BOARD-MOVE-006 | Board is initialized. `movePiece(0, 0, 8, 0)` is called. | Move is rejected because the ending row is outside the board. | :x: |
