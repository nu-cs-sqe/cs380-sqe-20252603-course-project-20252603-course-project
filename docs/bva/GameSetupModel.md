# GameSetupModel BVA

The methods documented here were introduced alongside the controller-side
validation move (`isNameAvailable`, `clearPlayers`). The model is the source
of truth for setup-time player state (`players`, `usedNames`, `usedColors`,
`turnOrder`).

---

### Method under test: `isNameAvailable(String name)`

Step 1:
- Input: name
- Input: state of the model (usedNames set)
- Output: boolean
- Output: state of the model (unchanged — read-only, no side effects)

Step 2:
- name - String; cases: not present in usedNames, present in usedNames
(case-exact match), present in usedNames but with differing case, ""
(empty)
- State.usedNames - set of strings; cases: empty, contains one or more
names
- Output - boolean; cases: true, false
- State (post-call) - cases: unchanged across all inputs (read-only)

Step 3:
- Input: an unused name on an empty model; a name equal (case-sensitive) to
one already used; the same characters with differing case; "" on an empty
model (model does not reject blanks — that responsibility belongs to the
controller); a name distinct from one already used
- Output: true / false
- State: unchanged across all cases

|             | System under test                                | Expected output                                | Implemented?       |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Test Case 1 | empty model; name="Alice"                        | true                                           | :white_check_mark: |
| Test Case 2 | model has player ("Alice", "Red"); name="Alice"  | false                                          | :white_check_mark: |
| Test Case 3 | model has player ("Alice", "Red"); name="alice"  | true (case-sensitive)                          | :white_check_mark: |
| Test Case 4 | empty model; name=""                             | true (model does not reject blanks)            | :white_check_mark: |
| Test Case 5 | model has player ("Alice", "Red"); name="Bob"    | true (other names unaffected)                  | :white_check_mark: |

### Method under test: `clearPlayers()`

Step 1:
- Input: state of the model (players, usedNames, usedColors, turnOrder)
- Output: state of the model (all four player-state fields emptied; board
and decks intentionally preserved)

Step 2:
- State.players - list of Player; cases: empty, populated
- State.usedNames - set of strings; cases: empty, populated
- State.usedColors - set of strings; cases: empty, populated
- State.turnOrder - list of Player; cases: empty, populated (after
determineTurnOrder has been called)
- State.board, State.resourceDeck, State.developmentCardDeck - cases:
untouched (preserved across the call)

Step 3:
- Input: model with one or more players added (and optionally a determined
turn order)
- Output: getPlayerCount() == 0; previously-used names and colors become
available again; turn order list is empty
- Cross-cutting: a previously-used (name, color) pair can be re-added
successfully after clear

|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Test Case 6 | model has 2 players added and a determined turn order              | getPlayerCount() == 0; previously-used name and color available again; getTurnOrder() empty    | :white_check_mark: |
| Test Case 7 | model previously had ("Alice", "Red"), then cleared                | re-adding ("Alice", "Red") succeeds and is reflected in getPlayer(0)                           | :white_check_mark: |

### Method under test: `isColorAvailable(PlayerColor color)`

|             | System under test                              | Expected output | Implemented?       |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Test Case 8 | empty model; color = RED                       | true            | :white_check_mark: |
| Test Case 9 | model has player with RED; color = RED         | false           | :white_check_mark: |

### Method under test: `setResourceDeck(ResourceDeck)` / `getResourceDeck()`

|              | System under test                     | Expected output                          | Implemented?       |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Test Case 10 | setResourceDeck(mockDeck)             | getResourceDeck() returns same instance  | :white_check_mark: |
| Test Case 11 | no deck set                           | getResourceDeck() returns null           | :white_check_mark: |

---

### Method under test: `setDevelopmentCardDeck(DevelopmentCardDeck)` / `getDevelopmentCardDeck()`

|              | System under test                          | Expected output                                   | Implemented?       |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Test Case 12 | setDevelopmentCardDeck(mockDeck)           | getDevelopmentCardDeck() returns same instance    | :white_check_mark: |
| Test Case 13 | no deck set                                | getDevelopmentCardDeck() returns null             | :white_check_mark: |

---

### Method under test: `createGameModel()`

Creates a `GameModel` from current players and board state.

|              | System under test                              | Expected output            | Implemented?       |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|
| Test Case 14 | model has 2 players added (Alice/RED, Bob/BLUE) | returns non-null GameModel | :white_check_mark: |

---

### Method under test: `getBoard()`

Returns the `BoardHandler` instance held by the model. The board is created
in the constructor and is never null.

Step 1:
- Output: BoardHandler instance

Step 2:
- Output - object reference; cases: non-null (always, constructor initialises it)

Step 3:
- Output: non-null BoardHandler on a freshly constructed model

|              | System under test         | Expected output              | Implemented?       |
|--------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|
| Test Case 15 | freshly constructed model | getBoard() returns non-null  | :white_check_mark: |
