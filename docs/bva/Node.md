## domain.Node Class
int id -> node id, for use in id to node object map in board
Player occupant -> player object or null
InfraType infraType -> SETTLEMENT, CITY, null

## Methods
getNodeOccupant() -> returns the player of the node
buildSettlement(Player player) -> sets node occupant to player and infraType to settlement
buildCity() -> changes infraType from settlement to city
getInfraType() -> returns settlement or city or null

- **TC1: Successful upgrade settlement to city"** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State of the system**: Node.occupant == player1, Node.infraType == settlement
  - **Expected output**: Node.occupant == player1, Node.infraType == city

- **TC2: Unsuccessful upgrade city to city** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State of the system**: Node.occupant == player1, Node.infraType == city
  - **Expected output**: Node.occupant == player1, Node.infraType == city, IllegalStateException: "Cannot upgrade a city further."

- **TC3: Unsuccessful upgrade unoccupied node to city** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State of the system**: Node.occupant == null, Node.infraType == null
  - **Expected output**: Node.occupant == null, Node.infraType == null, IllegalStateException: "Cannot upgrade an unsettled node to city."

- **TC4: Unsuccessful upgrade city on someone else's settlement** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State of the system**: Node.occupant == player1, Node.infraType == settlement, player == player2
  - **Expected output**: Node.occupant == player1, Node.infraType == settlement, IllegalStateException: "Cannot build a city on an already-settled node."

### Method under test: `getInfraType()`
#### Inputs:

  - Type: cases
  - Candidates: settlement, city, null
#### Outputs:
- infraType
  - Type: cases
  - Candidates: settlement, city, null

- **TC1: Unoccupied node, return empty string** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State of the system**: Node.infraType == null
  - **Expected output**: null

- **TC2: domain.Node occupied by settlement, return settlement** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State of the system**: Node.infraType == settlement
  - **Expected output**: settlement

- **TC3: domain.Node occupied by city, return city** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State of the system**: Node.infraType == city
  - **Expected output**: city


### Method under test: `equals(Object o)`

*Returns whether two Node objects are considered equal based on their IDs.*

#### Inputs:
- ID of first node
  - Type: interval
  - Candidates: MIN (0),MAX (53)

- ID of second node
  - Type: interval
  - Candidates: MIN (0), MAX (53)

- Equality relationship between IDs
  - Type: cases
  - Candidates: same ID, different ID

#### Outputs:
- Equality result
  - Type: boolean
  - Candidates: true, false

- **TC1: Nodes with same minimum ID are equal** (:white_check_mark:)
  - **State of the system**: `node1.id == 0`, `node2.id == 0`
  - **Expected output**: `true`

- **TC2: Nodes with same maximum ID are equal** (:white_check_mark:)
  - **State of the system**: `node1.id == 53`, `node2.id == 53`
  - **Expected output**: `true`

- **TC3: Nodes with different IDs are not equal** (:white_check_mark:)
  - **State of the system**: `node1.id == 0`, `node2.id == 1`
  - **Expected output**: `false`
- 
### Method under test: `hashCode()`

*Returns a hash code for the node based on its ID, so nodes with the same ID can be used correctly as keys.*

#### Inputs:
- State of the node -> value of `id`
  - Type: interval
  - Candidates: MIN (0), MAX (53)

- Equality relationship between node IDs
  - Type: cases
  - Candidates: same ID, different ID

#### Outputs:
- Hash code
  - Type: case
  - Candidates: same for equal nodes, unspecified for unequal nodes

- **TC1: Nodes with same minimum ID return same hash code** (:white_check_mark:)
  - **State of the system**: `node1.id == 0`, `node2.id == 0`
  - **Expected output**: `node1.hashCode() == node2.hashCode()`

- **TC2: Nodes with same maximum ID return same hash code** (:white_check_mark:)
  - **State of the system**: `node1.id == 53`, `node2.id == 53`
  - **Expected output**: `node1.hashCode() == node2.hashCode()`

- **TC3: Nodes with different IDs may return different hash codes** (:white_check_mark:)
  - **State of the system**: `node1.id == 0`, `node2.id == 1`
  - **Expected output**: hash codes are different
