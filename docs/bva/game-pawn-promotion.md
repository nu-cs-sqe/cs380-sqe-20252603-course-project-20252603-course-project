# BVA Analysis for Pawn Promotion

## Specification

A pawn promotes when it reaches the other side of the board. White promotes at row 7, black at row 0. The player picks what to promote to: Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight. King and Pawn are not allowed. canPromote tells us if a square has a pawn ready to promote. promote does the swap, and throws if the square is wrong or the type is not allowed.
