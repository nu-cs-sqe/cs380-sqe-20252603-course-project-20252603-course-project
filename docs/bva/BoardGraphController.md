### Method under test: `playerClaimStoredEdgeSetupPhase(PlayerColor color, int nodeID, int startingNodeID, int endingNodeID)`

#### Inputs:
- PlayerColor -> RED, BLUE, ORANGE, WHITE
- State of nodeID -> does player actually own it?
- nodeID -> ID of node just claimed
- Edge -> neighbors nodeID or not; (as part of setup phase, player must place edge immediately next to just placed settlement)
- Edge -> claimed or not;

#### Outputs:
- Boolean: True
  - Change of state of system -> edge claimed on by player
- Error -> "Edge must be adjacent to just placed settlement"
- Error -> "Edge already claimed"
- Error -> "During setup phase, player must own node next to edge they want to claim"

### Method under test: `playerClaimStoredEdge(PlayerColor color, int startingNodeID, int endingNodeID)`

#### Inputs:
- PlayerColor -> RED, BLUE, ORANGE, WHITE
- Edge -> Cases: claimed or not; player owns adjacent road or not (technically, the rules say an adjacent structure, but by the rules of building, after the setup phase, if they are building a road next to a settlement, then that settlement would at least have one road attached to it; so we can just check adjacent edges)
#### Outputs:
- Change of state of system -> edge claimed on by player
- Exception Type: IllegalEdgeClaim
- Error -> "Edge must be adjacent to an owned structure"
- Error -> "Edge already claimed"
