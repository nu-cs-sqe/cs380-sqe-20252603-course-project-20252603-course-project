# BVA Analysis for Chess Clock

## Specification

The chess clock gives both players a starting amount of time. Only the current player's time goes down. After a player makes a move, their clock stops, their increment is added, and the other player's clock starts. If a player reaches 0 seconds, that player loses by timeout.
