# GameModel BVA

`GameModel` coordinates the game state: it enforces phase rules, checks resource costs, delegates board
mutations to `BoardHandler`, and deducts resources from the current player.

### Method under test: `performTurn(int roll)`

Transitions phase from `BEFORE_ROLL` to `GENERAL_PLAY` (non-7) or `MOVE_ROBBER` (7).
Throws `IllegalGamePhaseException` if called outside `BEFORE_ROLL`.
Wraps `EmptyDeckException` as `IllegalArgumentException` if a resource deck is empty during distribution.

Step 1:

- Input: roll (int)
- State: current game phase
- Output: phase transitions to GENERAL_PLAY (roll ≠ 7) or MOVE_ROBBER (roll = 7)
- Output: exception when current phase is not BEFORE_ROLL

Step 2:

- roll: Interval [2, 12]; special value 7
- Game phase: BEFORE_ROLL (valid); any other (invalid)

Step 3:

- roll: 2 (LOW), 7 (robber trigger), 12 (HIGH)
- phase: BEFORE_ROLL (valid); GENERAL_PLAY (already rolled — invalid)

| Test Case 6 | BEFORE_ROLL, roll = 6, WOOL resource deck throws EmptyDeckException | IllegalArgumentException with same message as EmptyDeckException | :white_check_mark: |

### Method under test: `endTurn()`

Advances to the next player and resets phase to `BEFORE_ROLL`. Throws `IllegalGamePhaseException`
if called outside `GENERAL_PLAY`.

Step 1:

- State: current game phase, player turn order
- Output: phase resets to BEFORE_ROLL; next player becomes current
- Output: exception when current phase is not GENERAL_PLAY

Step 2:

- Game phase: GENERAL_PLAY (valid); BEFORE_ROLL (invalid); MOVE_ROBBER (invalid)

Step 3:

- phase: GENERAL_PLAY; BEFORE_ROLL (invalid); MOVE_ROBBER (invalid)

### Method under test: `attemptBuildSettlement(nodeID)`

Cost: 1 brick + 1 grain + 1 lumber + 1 wool. Max 5 settlements per player.
Resource check iterates in enum ordinal order: BRICK → GRAIN → LUMBER → WOOL.

Step 1:

- Input: nodeID (board position)
- State: current game phase, settlement count, per-resource counts (brick, grain, lumber, wool)
- Output: settlement placed, resources deducted, decks replenished, settlement count incremented

- Game phase: Case {GENERAL_PLAY (allowed), any other (not allowed)}
- Settlement count: Interval [0, 5]; max = 5
- Per resource (brick, grain, lumber, wool): Interval [0, 19]; cost boundary = 1

Step 3:

- Game phase: GENERAL_PLAY; RESOURCE_PRODUCTION (representative invalid); BEFORE_ROLL
- Settlement count: 0 (LOW); 4 (HIGH−1); 5 (HIGH — exceeds max)
- Brick (first checked): 0 (below cost); 1 (at cost); 2 (surplus)
- Grain (second checked): 0 (below cost, brick already ≥ 1); 1 (at cost)
- Lumber (third checked): 0 (below cost, brick & grain already ≥ 1); 1 (at cost)

### Method  under test: `performTurn(int roll)` — resource distribution path

When roll ≠ 7, `performTurn` delegates to `distributeResources`, which calls `board.computeResourceDemand(roll)` and distributes resources per the following rules:
- **Multiple players competing for a resource**: if the bank deck has fewer cards than total demand, **no player receives that resource** (all-or-nothing).
- **Single player owed a resource**: the player receives however many cards the bank has, which may be a partial amount (including zero if the bank is empty).

Each resource is evaluated independently.

Step 1:

- Input: roll (die value)
- Input: Demand map returned by `board.computeResourceDemand(roll)` (Map<Resource, Map<Player, Integer>>)
- Input: Bank deck sizes per resource (Interval [0, 19])
- Output: Player resource counts updated; decks drawn; game phase transitions to GENERAL_PLAY
- Output: No change (bank insufficient for multi-player resource, or demand map empty, or bank empty for single player)

Step 2:

- roll: Cases {7 (robber, no distribution), non-7 (distribution path)}
- Demand map: Cases {empty (no active hexes), non-empty}
- Per resource, number of players: Cases {single player, multiple players}
  - Single player: deck drawn up to demand; player receives `drawn` amount (partial if bank short, nothing if bank empty)
  - Multiple players: deck.total < total demand → no distribution; deck.total ≥ total demand → each player draws their amount
- Single-player demand amount: 1 (settlement) or 2 (city)
- Multiple resources in demand: each evaluated independently

Step 3:

- roll: non-7 value (e.g. 6) for distribution path; 7 for robber path
- Demand map: empty; one resource one player; one resource two players; two resources
- Single player, deck sizes: 0 (empty → player gets 0); partial (bank < owed → player gets partial); full (bank ≥ owed)
- Multiple players, deck sizes: 1 vs. demand of 2 (insufficient → no one gets any); 2 (exactly covers two players of 1 each)
- Demand amount: 1 (settlement); 2 (city)
- Two resources, one covered, one not: only covered resource distributes

Ends the current player's turn

Inputs:
- State of Game, 
  - if checkCurrentPlayerHasTenOrMoreVictoryPoints() passes and GamePhase is in END_GAME, phase stays in end_game and currentPlayerColor Stays the same
  - else, gamePhase switches to BEFORE_ROLL, currentPlayerColor changes
  - Collection of players RED -> ORANGE -> WHITE -> BLUE
  - GamePhase needs to start in GENERAL_PLAY

Outputs:
- GamePhase -> END_GAME or BEFORE_ROLL
- currentPlayerColor -> stays the same, changes (RED, ORANGE, WHITE, BLUE)

### Method under test: `buyDevCard(DevelopmentCardDeck deck)`

Cost: 1 ORE + 1 WOOL + 1 GRAIN. Valid phase: GENERAL_PLAY only.
Resource check order (matching existing GameModel convention): ORE → WOOL → GRAIN.
The deck is drawn **after** resources are validated; resources are deducted only on a successful draw.
The ORE, WOOL, and GRAIN resource decks are replenished by 1 each on success.
Returns the drawn `DevelopmentCard`.

Step 1:

- Input: deck (DevelopmentCardDeck)
- State: current game phase, current player's ORE/WOOL/GRAIN counts, deck size
- Output: DevelopmentCard drawn; player's ORE/WOOL/GRAIN each decremented by 1; ORE/WOOL/GRAIN resource decks each replenished by 1; card added to player's hand
- Output: exception

Step 2:

- Game phase: Case {GENERAL_PLAY (allowed), others (not allowed)}
- Player ORE: Interval [0, 19]; cost boundary = 1
- Player WOOL: Interval [0, 19]; cost boundary = 1
- Player GRAIN: Interval [0, 19]; cost boundary = 1
- Deck size: Interval [0, 25]; boundary values: 0 (empty), 1 (last card), 25 (full)

Step 3:

- Game phase: GENERAL_PLAY; BEFORE_ROLL (invalid); MOVE_ROBBER (invalid)
- ORE (first checked): 0 (below cost); 1 (at cost boundary); 3 (surplus)
- WOOL (second checked): 0 (below cost, ORE already ≥ 1); 1 (at cost boundary)
- GRAIN (third checked): 0 (below cost, ORE/WOOL already ≥ 1); 1 (at cost boundary)
- Deck size: 0 (empty — EmptyDeckException after resource check passes); 1 (last card); 25 (full)

### Method under test: `playDevCard(DevelopmentCard card)`

Validates that the current phase allows playing a development card and transitions
the game phase based on card type. This method is purely a game-state coordinator —
it does not execute card effects. Card effects (robber movement, road placement,
resource transfer) are triggered separately via the resulting phase.

Valid phases: `BEFORE_ROLL` and `GENERAL_PLAY` (dev cards may be played before or
after rolling dice per official Catan rules).

Phase transitions:
- `KNIGHT` → `MOVE_ROBBER`
- `ROAD_BUILDER` → `ROAD_BUILDING_DEV_CARD`
- `MONOPOLY` → `MONOPOLY_DEV_CARD`
- `YEAR_OF_PLENTY` → phase unchanged
- `VICTORY_POINT` → phase unchanged

Step 1:

- Input: card (DevelopmentCard)
- State: current game phase, card type
- Output: phase transitions per card type above
- Output: exception

Step 2:

- card: Pointer; null (invalid)
- card type: Case {KNIGHT, ROAD_BUILDER, MONOPOLY, YEAR_OF_PLENTY, VICTORY_POINT}
- Game phase: Case {BEFORE_ROLL or GENERAL_PLAY (valid), all others (invalid)}

Step 3:

- card: null (invalid); valid card
- card type: KNIGHT; ROAD_BUILDER; MONOPOLY; YEAR_OF_PLENTY; VICTORY_POINT
- Game phase: GENERAL_PLAY (valid); BEFORE_ROLL (valid); MOVE_ROBBER (invalid representative)

### Method under test: `moveRobberAndSteal()`

Handles moving robber after a 7 has been rolled

Inputs:

  - Robber -> location [0, 18] -> unfeasible to be negative 1 or 19
- Board state
  - Is target on Hex?

Outputs:
- IllegalArgumentException -> 
  - "Target must be on same hex as robber"
  - "Invalid hex ID, must be in interval [0, 18]"
  - "Invalid hex ID, robber can not be played on same hex"
- Valid move
  - Verify resources updated on players
