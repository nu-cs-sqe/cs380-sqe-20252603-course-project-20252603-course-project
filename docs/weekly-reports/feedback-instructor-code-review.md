# Instructor Code Review Feedback

**Contact**: Dr. Yiji Zhang (yiji.zhang@northwestern.edu)

**Purpose of This Document**:
The instructor will perform code review with respect to software design, error handling, format and style on the main branch every week starting Week 6 using the letter grade A standards.
The following chapters of the textbook are considered: Chapter 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10. The corresponding lectures are considered, too.

Please note that this feedback does not include evaluation of your progress, the proper use of linters, the quality of your test cases, or your compliance of TDD/BDD workflow.  
You can find the weekly feedback from your dedicated PM/TA for that.

## Week 6 Code Review
I have read every line of code currently in the main branch. 
I noticed that your Territory class has a bunch of null checks. So here are a couple of things to consider:
1) indeed, it is generally a good practice to do "defense programming". Your null check is a great example.
2) However, what uncle Bob argues in the book is that instead of doing null check everywhere, especially in a language like Java, we should make sure we don't pass null around, period.
3) If you work on an API or a library that is designed to be used by others, the null check is more important. Or, if you work in a language like C or C++ where there is pointer allowed, it is more important to check for null explicitly and thoroughly. 

So, what's the conclusion? In general, for this course project, since you are developing a standalone application in Java, it is less important to do null check. Instead, we should focus on making sure we don't pass null around.
 
Look forward to reviewing more of your domain logic in the next review.

Please approve and merge the PR once the team has read the feedback. Thanks!
