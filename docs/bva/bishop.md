## Bishop(Color color)

### Step 1 - Inputs and Outputs
- Input #1: bishop color
- Output #1: Bishop object
- Output #2: exception

### Step 2 - Data Types
- Input #1: Case
- Output #1: Reference
- Output #2: Case

### Step 3 - Concrete Values
- Input #1: WHITE, BLACK, null
- Output #1: valid Bishop object
- Output #2: exception

### Step 4 - Test Cases
- **TC1: create white bishop** ( ✅ )
	- **State of the system**: color = WHITE
	- **Expected output**: Bishop is created; `color()` returns WHITE; `type()` returns BISHOP

## candidateMoves(Square from, Board board)

### Step 1 - Inputs and Outputs
- Input #1: source square
- Input #2: board state
- Output #1: set of candidate destination squares
- Output #2: exception

### Step 2 - Data Types
- Input #1: Reference
- Input #2: Reference
- Output #1: Collection
- Output #2: Case

### Step 3 - Concrete Values
- Source square: center square (3, 3), corner square (0, 0), edge square (0, 3), null
- Board state: empty board, friendly piece on diagonal, opponent piece on diagonal,
  blockers beyond a capture, null
- Output: all diagonal squares, reduced edge/corner diagonals, friendly square excluded,
  opponent square included, beyond-blocker squares excluded, exception

### Step 4 - Test Cases
- **TC2: center square has all diagonal candidate moves** ( ✅ )
	- **State of the system**: white bishop at (3, 3), otherwise empty board
	- **Expected output**: candidate moves are all on-board diagonal squares from (3, 3)

- **TC3: corner square has one diagonal ray** ( ✅ )
	- **State of the system**: white bishop at (0, 0), otherwise empty board
	- **Expected output**: candidate moves are (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4),
	  (5, 5), (6, 6), and (7, 7)

- **TC4: edge square has only on-board diagonal rays** ( ✅ )
	- **State of the system**: white bishop at (0, 3), otherwise empty board
	- **Expected output**: candidate moves are (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6), (4, 7),
	  (1, 2), (2, 1), and (3, 0)

- **TC5: friendly piece blocks diagonal movement** ( ✅ )
	- **State of the system**: white bishop at (3, 3), white pawn at (5, 5)
	- **Expected output**: (5, 5) and squares beyond it on that diagonal are not included

- **TC6: opponent piece can be captured and blocks beyond squares** ( ✅ )
	- **State of the system**: white bishop at (3, 3), black pawn at (5, 5)
	- **Expected output**: (5, 5) is included; (6, 6) and (7, 7) are not included

- **TC7: null source square is rejected** ( ✅ )
	- **State of the system**: source square = null, board = empty board
	- **Expected output**: exception

- **TC8: null board is rejected** ( ✅ )
	- **State of the system**: source square = (3, 3), board = null
	- **Expected output**: exception
