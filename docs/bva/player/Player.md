# Player BVA

`Player` holds a player's name, victory points, settlements, roads, and resources.
Its three public methods are `placeSettlement(vertex)`, `placeRoad(edge)`, and
`receiveResources(resources)`. Per standard Catan rules each player has 5 settlement
pieces and 15 road pieces. `DESERT` is not a receivable resource.

### Method under test: `placeSettlement(vertex)`

Step 1:

- Input: vertex
- State: settlement count, vertex occupancy, distance rule compliance (whether the attempt follows the distance rule)
- Output: settlement appended to player's settlements list
- Output: exception

Step 2:

- vertex: Pointer
- Non-null vertex: Case
- settlement count: Interval [0, 5], Appending a Single Element
- Output (settlement appended): Boolean
- Output (exception thrown): Boolean

Step 3:

- Input vertex (Pointer / Case): null; valid (unoccupied, distance rule OK); occupied; distance rule violated
- Input settlement count (Interval [0, 5]): −1 (CAN'T SET); 0 (LOW); 4 (last element that fits); 5 (HIGH — CAN'T ADD); 6 (CAN'T SET)
- Output: settlement appended to player's settlements list
- Output: "Vertex cannot be null." / "Vertex is already occupied." / "Settlement violates the distance rule." / "No settlements remaining."

### Method under test: `placeRoad(edge)`

Step 1:

- Input: edge
- State: road count, edge occupancy, connectivity to player's network
- Output: road appended to player's roads list
- Output: exception

Step 2:

- edge: Pointer
- Non-null edge: Case
- road count: Interval [0, 15], Appending a Single Element
- Output (road appended): Boolean
- Output (exception thrown): Boolean

Step 3:

- Input edge (Pointer / Case): null; valid (unoccupied, connected to player's network); occupied; not connected to player's network
- Input road count (Interval [0, 15]): −1 (CAN'T SET); 0 (LOW); 14 (last element that fits); 15 (HIGH — CAN'T ADD); 16 (CAN'T SET)
- Output: road appended to player's roads list
- Output: "Edge cannot be null." / "Edge is already occupied." / "Road must connect to player's existing network." / "No roads remaining."

### Method under test: `receiveResources(resources)`

- Output: each quantity merged into player's resources map
- Output: exception

Step 2:

- resources: Pointer
- Non-null resources: Size of Collection
- ResourceType per entry: Case
- quantity per entry: Interval [1, 19]
- Output (resources map updated): Boolean
- Output (exception thrown): Boolean

Step 3:

- Input resources (Pointer / Size of Collection): null; {} (empty); one entry; more than one entry
- Input ResourceType (Case): WOOD; BRICK; SHEEP; WHEAT; ORE; DESERT (invalid)
