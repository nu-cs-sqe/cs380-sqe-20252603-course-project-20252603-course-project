# Week 6 Project Feedback by PM/TA

**Dedicated PM/TA**: Jiahao Yu

## How to Read This Feedback
> [!NOTE]
> **Purpose.** This feedback focuses on your team's progress and collaboration. It is meant as guidance, not judgement.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Scope.** For the BVA and TDD items, the PM/TA evaluates only the `main` branch. Ongoing work in feature branches will be evaluated after it is merged. If you'd like early feedback on work in progress, please reach out to your PM/TA directly.

> [!TIP]
> **Mistakes are expected :).** As the instructor mentioned in class, early mistakes are part of the learning process. As long as your team addresses the issues after you get the feedback, your grade will not suffer from them.

| 1 | Checkstyle: Checkstyle is set up or there is a to-do item planned in the Project Management board for this task. (needed for Letter Grade B) |   ✅   | Checkstyle is configured directly in `build.gradle.kts` on `main`, and PR #21 shows it was intentionally tied to the grading criteria. | Week 6 Monday lecture (Lecture 11); the build script and config file in the repository for Lab: Code Coverage |

| 5 | Overall development progress (recall the recommended order is: Game Setup Phase -> One turn of the game -> Multiple turns -> One win condition -> Other win conditions (if applicable) |     ⚠️     | There is strong visible progress on `main`. However, the Game Setup Phase is still not fully complete on `main` because core integration is still incomplete: for example, `Board.getSnapshot()` still returns `null`, `BoardController.handleSquareClick(...)` is still a TODO, and `Main.java` is empty. Please prioritize finishing and integrating the remaining setup/game flow before moving deeper into later phases. | Canvas assignment Project: Week 4 and 5 Guidance |

### The following items are not checked by the reviewer this week as they were checked in the previous weeks
If your team wants the reviewer to check any of these for any reasons, please contact them or the instructor via either email or tag/mention them in the feedback PR.

## Additional Comments
Your `main` branch shows much stronger integration progress this week than last week, especially because the quality tools are now actually configured in the build and the piece/domain work is merged rather than staying only in draft PRs. That is a meaningful improvement.

I also saw better visible collaboration in PR review discussion this week, especially in PR #24, where a teammate raised a specific BVA concern, got a thoughtful technical explanation, and saw the missing case addressed before approval. Please keep doing that. The next big step is to bring the same level of discipline to the remaining setup/game integration work and to merge the Week 6 report into `main`.
