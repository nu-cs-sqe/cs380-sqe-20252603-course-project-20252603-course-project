# DevCardController BVA

**MVC Layer: Controller** (`ui.controller.DevCardController`)

`DevCardController` is a thin controller in the MVC architecture that mediates
between the View layer and the domain model/handler for development card
operations. Following the project's established controller pattern (see
`GameLoopController`, `GameSetupController`), this controller is **stateless** —
it receives the `GameModel` as a parameter and delegates all business logic to
the model and `DevelopmentCardHandler`.

**Design Principles:**
- **Single Responsibility**: The controller's only job is to translate user
  actions into domain calls and return results to the view. It does not contain
  game rules or precondition validation — those live in `DevelopmentCardHandler`.
- **Separation of Concerns**: All validation, preconditions (P1–P4), and game
  logic live in `DevelopmentCardHandler`; the controller only delegates and
  relays exceptions.
- **Testability**: Because the controller is stateless and delegates to
  injected/passed dependencies, each method can be tested with mock objects
  (following the `GameLoopControllerTest` pattern using EasyMock).

**Phase note (per official Catan rules):** Development cards may be played at
any time during a player's turn — before rolling dice (`BEFORE_ROLL`) or after
(`GENERAL_PLAY`). The controller does not enforce phase restrictions on `play*`
methods; phase validation (if needed) is the responsibility of the game loop.

### Method under test: `buyDevelopmentCard(GameModel model, DevelopmentCardDeck deck)`

This method delegates to `DevelopmentCardHandler.buyDevelopmentCard()` using
the current player and current round from the model.

Step 1:

- Input: model, deck
- Output: DevelopmentCard (result from handler)
- Output: exception (relayed from handler)

Step 2:

- model: Pointer (mock)
- deck: Pointer (mock)
- Output: delegation result from DevelopmentCardHandler

Step 3:

- Verify controller calls model.getCurrentPlayer() and model.getCurrentRound() and passes results to handler
- Verify controller relays the DevelopmentCard returned by handler
- Verify controller relays IllegalStateException from handler when resources insufficient
- Verify controller relays EmptyDeckException from handler when deck empty

### Method under test: `playKnightCard(GameModel model, DevelopmentCard card, Robber robber, int targetHexId, Player victim)`

This method delegates to `DevelopmentCardHandler.playKnightCard()` using the
current player and current round from the model.

Step 1:

- Input: model, card, robber, targetHexId, victim
- Output: void (side effects in model via handler)
- Output: exception (relayed from handler)

Step 2:

- model: Pointer (mock)
- card: Pointer (mock or invalid)
- robber: Pointer (mock or null)
- targetHexId: Interval [0, 18]
- victim: Pointer (mock or null)
- Output: delegation verified via mock expectations

Step 3:

- Verify controller extracts current player and current round from model and delegates to handler
- Verify controller relays success (handler completes normally)
- Verify controller relays exceptions from handler (precondition violations, invalid hex, etc.)
