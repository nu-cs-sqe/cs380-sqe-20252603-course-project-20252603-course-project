Feature: Build through the player action menu (GUI)
  As a player
  I want to build roads, settlements, and cities from the action menu
  So that I can expand my position during normal play

  Background:
    Given a game with a current player
    And an initialized board

  Scenario Outline: Player builds a settlement through the action menu
    Given the player has the resources to build settlement
    And the player has at least one settlement in their inventory
    When the player clicks Build
    And the player selects settlement
    And the player clicks node <locationId>
    And the player confirms the build
    Then node <locationId> should be occupied by the player's settlement
    And the player's inventory should decrease by one settlement
    And the player's resources should decrease by the cost of building settlement

    Examples:
      | locationId |
      | 1          |
      | 10         |

  Scenario Outline: Player builds a road connected to their settlement through the action menu
    Given the player has a settlement at an endpoint of edge <locationId>
    And the player has the resources to build road
    And the player has at least one road in their inventory
    When the player clicks Build

    And the player confirms the build
    Then edge <locationId> should be occupied by the player's road
    And the player's inventory should decrease by one road
    And the player's resources should decrease by the cost of building road

      | locationId |
      | 1          |
      | 10         |

  Scenario Outline: Player upgrades their settlement to a city through the action menu
    Given node <locationId> already has the player's settlement

    And the player has at least one city in their inventory
    When the player clicks Build
    And the player selects city
    And the player clicks node <locationId>
    And the player confirms the build
    Then node <locationId> should be occupied by the player's city

      | locationId |
      | 1          |
      | 8          |
