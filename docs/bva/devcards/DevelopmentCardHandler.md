# DevelopmentCardHandler BVA

**MVC Layer: Model / Domain Service** (`domain.model.DevelopmentCardHandler`)

`DevelopmentCardHandler` is a domain-level service responsible for all
development card business logic: buying cards from the deck and executing
each card type's effect. This follows the same architectural pattern as
`DiceHandler`, `TradeManager`, and `Robber` in the existing codebase —
domain services that encapsulate game rules without coupling to the UI.

Since the controller (`DevCardController`) is intentionally thin — pure
delegation with no game-rule logic — all preconditions, validation, and
card effects live here.

**Design Principles:**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each public method handles exactly one card
  operation. The handler does not manage deck state (that is
  `DevelopmentCardDeck`'s job) or player identity (that is `Player`'s job).
- **Open/Closed**: Adding a new card type requires adding a new `play*` method
  (or, for further extensibility, a Strategy/Command pattern could be introduced
  where each `DevelopmentCardType` maps to a `CardEffectStrategy`).
- **Dependency Inversion**: The handler depends on abstractions (`Player`,
  `DevelopmentCardDeck`, `Robber`, `Edge`) rather than concrete UI classes.

---

## Common Card Preconditions (shared across all `play*` methods)

All `play*` methods enforce the following preconditions before executing card
effects. These are validated by the handler since the controller is thin.

| ID | Precondition | Violation | Expected result |
|----|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| P1 | `card` is not null | `card == null` | `IllegalArgumentException`: "Development card cannot be null." |
| P2 | `card.getType()` matches the expected type for the method | Type mismatch | `IllegalArgumentException`: "Card is not a {expectedType} card." |
| P3 | `card.isPlayable(currentRound)` returns true | Card purchased this turn (non-VP only) | `IllegalStateException`: "Card cannot be played the same turn it was purchased." |
| P4 | Current player has not already played a development card this turn | Already played | `IllegalStateException`: "Already played a development card this turn." |

**Rules note (per official Catan rulebook):**
- P3 does **not** apply to Victory Point cards — VP cards may be revealed on
  the same turn they are purchased.
- P4 applies to Knight and Progress cards only. Multiple VP cards may be
  revealed in the same turn.
- Dev cards may be played **before or after** rolling dice (i.e., during
  `BEFORE_ROLL` or `GENERAL_PLAY` phases).

**Post-play effects (per official Catan rulebook):**
- **Knight cards**: remain face-up in front of the player (kept in a
  `playedKnights` count or list for Largest Army tracking).
- **Progress cards** (Road Building, Year of Plenty, Monopoly): removed from
  the game after play (discarded from the player's hand, not returned to deck).
- **Victory Point cards**: remain hidden in hand until the player declares
  victory at 10+ points; they are never "played" in the discard sense.

### Method under test: `buyDevelopmentCard(Player buyer, DevelopmentCardDeck deck, int currentRound)`

Step 1:

- Input: buyer, deck, currentRound
- State: buyer's resource holdings (must have 1 ORE, 1 WOOL, 1 GRAIN), deck size
- Output: DevelopmentCard drawn from deck and added to buyer's hand
- Output: exception

Step 2:

- buyer: Pointer
- deck: Pointer
- deck size: Interval [0, 25]
- buyer resources: Pairs of Counts (ORE count, WOOL count, GRAIN count each ≥ 1)
- currentRound: Interval [0, ∞)
- Output (card drawn): Pointer (DevelopmentCard)
- Output (exception thrown): Boolean

Step 3:

- Input buyer (Pointer): null (CAN'T SET by controller guard); valid Player
- Input deck (Pointer): null (CAN'T SET by controller guard); valid DevelopmentCardDeck
- State deck size (Interval [0, 25]): 0 (empty — cannot buy); 1 (last card); 25 (full)
- State buyer ORE count (Count): 0 (insufficient); 1 (exactly enough); >1 (surplus)
- State buyer WOOL count (Count): 0 (insufficient); 1 (exactly enough); >1 (surplus)
- State buyer GRAIN count (Count): 0 (insufficient); 1 (exactly enough); >1 (surplus)
- Output: DevelopmentCard returned, buyer resources decremented (−1 ORE, −1 WOOL, −1 GRAIN), card added to buyer's hand, deck countRemaining() decremented by 1
- Output: "Not enough resources to buy a development card." / EmptyDeckException

### Method under test: `playKnightCard(Player player, DevelopmentCard card, int currentRound, Robber robber, int targetHexId, Player victim)`

Per official Catan rules: the player must move the robber to a **different**
terrain hex and may steal 1 random resource card from an opponent who has a
settlement or city **adjacent to the robber's new hex**. If the victim has no
resources, nothing is stolen. The knight card remains face-up in front of the
player and counts toward Largest Army. The played card is removed from the
player's hand.

Step 1:

- Input: player, card, currentRound, robber, targetHexId, victim
- State: robber's current hex location, victim's resource count, victim adjacency, player's played knight count, player's hasPlayedDevCardThisTurn flag
- Output: robber moved to targetHexId
- Output: 1 random resource transferred from victim to player (if applicable)
- Output: player's played knight count incremented
- Output: card removed from player's hand
- Output: exception

Step 2:

- card: Pointer / Case (must be KNIGHT) — see Common Preconditions P1–P4
- robber: Pointer
- targetHexId: Interval [0, 18]
- victim: Pointer (null allowed — no adjacent opponent)
- robber current location vs targetHexId: Pair of Intervals (must differ)
- victim adjacency: Boolean (must be adjacent to targetHexId if non-null)
- victim's resource count: Count [0, ∞)
- Output (robber moved): Boolean
- Output (resource stolen): Boolean
- Output (exception thrown): Boolean

Step 3:

- card (Common Preconditions): null (P1); wrong type (P2); not playable / same turn (P3); already played dev card (P4)
- Input robber (Pointer): null; valid Robber instance
- Input targetHexId (Interval [0, 18]): 0 (LOW); 18 (HIGH); same as current (invalid)
- Input targetHexId vs current location (Pair of Intervals): same hex (invalid); different hex (valid)
- Input victim (Pointer): null (no one adjacent); valid adjacent opponent; non-adjacent player (invalid)
- State victim resource count (Count): 0 (nothing to steal); 1 (steal the only card); >1 (steal 1 of many)
- Output: robber location updated / exceptions as listed

### Method under test: `playMonopolyCard(Player player, DevelopmentCard card, int currentRound, Resource resource, List<Player> otherPlayers)`

Per official Catan rules: the player announces 1 resource type. All other
players must surrender **all** cards of that type to the player. The progress
card is removed from the game (discarded from hand) after play.

Step 1:

- Input: player, card, currentRound, resource, otherPlayers
- State: each other player's holdings of the named resource
- Output: all cards of the named resource transferred from other players to player
- Output: card removed from player's hand (discarded)
- Output: exception

Step 2:

- card: Pointer / Case (must be MONOPOLY) — see Common Preconditions P1–P4
- resource: Pointer / Case (BRICK, GRAIN, LUMBER, ORE, WOOL; DESERT is invalid)
- otherPlayers: Pointer / Size of Collection
- per-player holdings of named resource: Count [0, 19]
- Output (resources transferred): Boolean
- Output (exception thrown): Boolean

Step 3:

- card (Common Preconditions): null (P1); wrong type (P2); not playable / same turn (P3); already played (P4)
- Input resource (Pointer / Case): null; BRICK; GRAIN; LUMBER; ORE; WOOL; DESERT (invalid)
- Input otherPlayers (Pointer / Size of Collection): null; empty list; one player; more than one player

- edge2: Pointer / Case (valid, occupied, not connected to network, null if only 1 road remaining)
- road count: Interval [0, 15], Appending a Single Element (up to twice)
- Output (roads placed): Count [0, 2]
- Output (exception thrown): Boolean

Step 3:

- card (Common Preconditions): null (P1); wrong type (P2); not playable / same turn (P3); already played (P4)
- Input edge1 (Pointer / Case): null; valid (unoccupied, connected); already occupied; not connected to network
- Input edge2 (Pointer / Case): null (only 1 road placed); valid; already occupied; not connected (including via edge1)
- State road count (Interval [0, 15]): 0 (LOW — 15 remaining); 13 (last pair that fits); 14 (only 1 remaining); 15 (HIGH — no roads remaining)
- Output: roads appended to player's road list; card removed from hand
- Output: "Edge cannot be null." / "Edge is already occupied." / "Road must connect to player's existing network." / "No roads remaining."

### Method under test: `countVictoryPointCards(List<DevelopmentCard> hand)`

Per official Catan rules: each Victory Point card (Library, Market, Chapel,
Great Hall, University) is worth 1 victory point. VP cards are kept hidden in
the player's hand and only revealed when the player declares victory at 10+
points. They are never "played" in the discard sense — they simply count
toward the point total.

Step 1:

- Input: hand (player's development card hand)
- Output: int (count of VICTORY_POINT cards in hand)

Step 2:

- hand: Pointer / Size of Collection
- Output: Count [0, 5]

Step 3:

- Input hand (Pointer / Size of Collection): null (CAN'T SET by caller); empty list; 1 VP card; >1 VP card; mixed VP and non-VP cards; no VP cards among non-VP cards
- Output (Count): 0 (no VP cards); 1; 5 (maximum VP cards in deck)
