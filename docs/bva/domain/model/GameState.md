# BVA Analysis for GameState

## Public interface for this class

- `GameState(players: List<Player>, deck: Deck)` (constructor) → GameState with ACTIVE status and initialized players
- `isActive()` → boolean
- `endGame()` → void
- `getCurrentPlayer()` → Player
- `advancePlayer()` → void
- `eliminateCurrentPlayer()` → void
- `activePlayerCount()` → int
- `drawFromDeck()` → Card
- `isDeckEmpty()` → boolean
- `insertIntoDeck(card: Card, index: int)` → void
- `shuffleDeck()` → void
- `discardCard(card: Card)` → void
- `addCardToCurrentPlayer(card: Card)` → void
- `removeCardFromCurrentPlayer(card: Card)` → void
- `currentPlayerHasCard(type: CardType)` → boolean
- `getOtherActivePlayers()` → List<Player>
- `peekTopOfDeck(n: int)` → List<Card>
- `getDeckSize()` → int
- `insertPendingCardAt(position: int)` → void
- `turnState()` → TurnState

## Assumptions and notes

- On construction, `status` is `ACTIVE`, `activePlayers` is populated from the passed list (preserving order), and `eliminatedPlayers` is empty.
- `getCurrentPlayer()` returns the player at the front of the queue without removing them; throws `IllegalStateException` if the queue is empty.
- `advancePlayer()` rotates the front player to the back of the queue.
- `eliminateCurrentPlayer()` removes the front player from the active queue and adds them to the eliminated list; throws `IllegalStateException` if only 1 player remains.
- `activePlayerCount()` returns the size of the active players queue.
- `drawFromDeck()` delegates to `deck.drawTop()`; throws `IllegalStateException` if the deck is empty.
- `insertIntoDeck(card, index)` delegates to `deck.insertAt(card, index)`; throws `IndexOutOfBoundsException` for invalid indices.
- `peekTopOfDeck(n)` returns the top n cards without removing them; throws `IllegalArgumentException` if n exceeds deck size.
- `getOtherActivePlayers()` returns an unmodifiable list of all active players except the current one.
- `insertPendingCardAt(position)` retrieves the pending card from `turnState` and inserts it into the deck at the given position; throws `IllegalStateException` if there is no pending action.
- `turnState()` returns the `TurnState` object owned by this `GameState`.



### Method under test: `GameState(players, deck)` (constructor)

spaces: initial field values

cases:

### Method under test: `isActive()`

spaces: status = {ACTIVE, ENDED}

cases:
- status is ACTIVE → true
- status is ENDED → false

| test_Name                         | State of the System            | Expected output | Implemented?        |

| isActive_StatusEnded_ReturnsFalse | status = ENDED (after endGame) | false           | :white_check_mark:  |



### Method under test: `endGame()`

spaces: status = {ACTIVE, already ENDED}

cases:
- game is active → isActive() becomes false
- game already ended → stays false, no throw

| test_Name                                    | State of the System   | Expected output      | Implemented?       |

### Method under test: `getCurrentPlayer()`

spaces: activePlayers size = {0, 1, 2+}

cases:
- empty queue → throw IllegalStateException
- one player → returns that player
- two or more players → returns the front player, not the second

| test_Name                                               | State of the System | Expected output           | Implemented?       |

### Method under test: `advancePlayer()`

spaces: activePlayers size = {1, 2+}

cases:
- one player → same player remains current after advance
- two or more players → front player moves to back; second player becomes current

| test_Name                                                    | State of the System | Expected output                            | Implemented?       |

| advancePlayer_MultiplePlayers_NextPlayerBecomesCurrentPlayer | 2+ active players   | getCurrentPlayer() returns second player   | :white_check_mark: |
| advancePlayer_MultiplePlayers_PreviousCurrentMovesToBack     | 2+ active players   | prior front player is now at back of queue | :white_check_mark: |



### Method under test: `getNextPlayer()`

spaces: activePlayers size = {0, 1, 2, 3+}

cases:
- size = 0 (N/A — eliminateCurrentPlayer guards against dropping below 1 active player)
- size = 1 → throws IllegalStateException (lower boundary: only one player, no next exists)
- size = 2 → returns second player (lower boundary of valid range; exactly one other player)
- size = 3+ → returns the second player in queue, not the third

note: getNextPlayer reads the queue without modifying it; getCurrentPlayer() is unchanged after the call

| getNextPlayer_MultiplePlayers_ReturnsSecondNotThirdPlayer            | 3 active players    | second player returned, not third       | :white_check_mark: |



### Method under test: `eliminateCurrentPlayer()`

spaces: activePlayers size = {1, 2, 3+}

cases:
- one player → throw IllegalStateException (cannot eliminate the sole remaining winner)
- two players (boundary: eliminating one leaves exactly 1 winner) → activePlayerCount = 1; next player becomes current; eliminated list grows
- three or more players → activePlayerCount decrements by 1; next player becomes current; eliminated list grows

| test_Name                                                             | State of the System | Expected output                            | Implemented?       |
