### BVA Documentation: Development Card Activation

To thoroughly test the transition states of the `isActive` boolean and ensure players cannot bypass game rules, the test
cases target these specific boundaries:

### BVA Documentation: Drawing a Development Card

A development card costs **1 Ore + 1 Wool (Sheep) + 1 Grain (Wheat)**. These cases target the boundary
between affording and not affording the draw, verifying the player is only charged on a successful draw.

| Test ID               | Scenario / Boundary Condition           | Input / State                                            | Expected Outcome                                                                                 | Implemented?      |
