# Player BVA

`Player` holds a player's name, victory points, settlements, roads, and resources.
Its three public methods are `placeSettlement()`, `placeRoad()`, and
`receiveResources(resources)`. Per standard Catan rules each player has 5 settlement
pieces and 15 road pieces. `DESERT` is not a receivable resource.

Board-level validations (vertex occupancy, distance rule, edge connectivity) are
the responsibility of `BoardHandler`, not `Player`.

### Method under test: `placeSettlement()`

Step 1:

- State: settlement count
- Output: settlement appended to player's settlements list
- Output: exception

Step 2:

- settlement count: Interval [0, 5], Appending a Single Element
- Output (settlement appended): Boolean
- Output (exception thrown): Boolean

Step 3:

- Input settlement count (Interval [0, 5]): −1 (CAN'T SET); 0 (LOW); 4 (last element that fits); 5 (HIGH — CAN'T ADD); 6 (CAN'T SET)
- Output: settlement appended to player's settlements list
- Output: "No settlements remaining."

| ----------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Test Case 1 | settlements = 0   | settlement appended to player's settlements list   | :white_check_mark: |
| Test Case 2 | settlements = 4   | settlement appended to player's settlements list   | :white_check_mark: |
| Test Case 3 | settlements = 5   | IllegalStateException: "No settlements remaining." | :white_check_mark: |

### Method under test: `placeRoad()`

Step 1:

- State: road count
- Output: road appended to player's roads list
- Output: exception

Step 2:

- road count: Interval [0, 15], Appending a Single Element
- Output (road appended): Boolean
- Output (exception thrown): Boolean

Step 3:

- Input road count (Interval [0, 15]): −1 (CAN'T SET); 0 (LOW); 14 (last element that fits); 15 (HIGH — CAN'T ADD); 16 (CAN'T SET)
- Output: road appended to player's roads list
- Output: "No roads remaining."

| Test Case 5 | roads = 14        | road appended to player's roads list         | :white_check_mark: |
| Test Case 6 | roads = 15        | IllegalStateException: "No roads remaining." | :white_check_mark: |

### Method under test: `receiveResources(resources)`

Step 1:

- Input: resources
- State: player's existing resources map
- Output: each quantity merged into player's resources map
- Output: exception

Step 2:

- resources: Pointer
- Non-null resources: Size of Collection
- ResourceType per entry: Case
- quantity per entry: Interval [1, 19]
- Output (resources map updated): Boolean
- Output (exception thrown): Boolean

Step 3:

- Input resources (Pointer / Size of Collection): null; {} (empty); one entry; more than one entry
- Input ResourceType (Case): LUMBER; BRICK; WOOL; ORE; GRAIN; DESERT (invalid)
- Input quantity (Interval [1, 19]): 0 (LOW−ε = CAN'T SET); 1 (LOW); 19 (HIGH); 20 (HIGH+ε = CAN'T SET)
- Output: player's resources map updated
- Output: "Resources cannot be null." / "Resource quantity must be at least 1." / "Cannot receive DESERT as a resource."

### Method under test: `updateVictoryPoints(int amount)`

Inputs:
- Amount -> integer -> Cases
  - 1 -> VP devcard, player builds a settlement, player builds a city
  - 2 -> longest road, largest army
  - -2 -> losing longest road, losing largest army
- State of Player -> How many VPs they have -> [0, 10]

Output
- Updated player state -> amount of VPs -> [0, 10]
  - Since players can only lose VPs in the scenario once they've gained them (i.e. losing longest road) it is not feasible that a player's points would ever be negative
