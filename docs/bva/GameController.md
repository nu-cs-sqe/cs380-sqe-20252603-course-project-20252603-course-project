# BVA: `GameController`

Main controller for game flow. Coordinates turns, player movement, tile effects, bankruptcy handling, and GUI updates through:

```java
Game game;
BoardView boardView;
PlayerInfoView playerInfoView;
DiceView diceView;
CardView cardView;
```

## Assumptions

- A valid game starts with 2 to 4 players.
- The board has 32 tiles, indexed from `0` to `31`.
- A normal dice roll total is from `2` to `12`.
- `refreshViews()` should run after successful game-state changes so the GUI reflects the current model state.
- These are specification-level BVA cases for the controller contract. Implementation status is marked as not implemented until matching tests/code exist.

## Turn-flow extension (end-to-end wiring)

These methods orchestrate a complete turn. Optional collaborators (`PropertyController`,
`CardController`, `JailController`, `PropertyPromptView`, `BankruptcyView`) are setter-injected
(default `null`) so the frozen 6-arg constructor and TC1–TC45 are untouched. Every collaborator that
is not under test is an EasyMock mock.

### Method under test: `resolveLanding()`

Resolves the effect of the tile the current player is standing on. Pure dispatch — one small handler
per tile category.

1. Input: current player + their board tile, Output: the correct tile effect / prompt is triggered
2. Input type: `Tile` subtype + property ownership + affordability
3. Input boundary values: unowned-affordable property, unowned-unaffordable property, property owned by
   another, property owned by self, IRS tile, chance tile, go-to-jail tile, GO tile, neutral tile

- **TC46: resolveLanding_OnUnownedAffordableProperty_ShowsPurchasePrompt** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State**: current tile is an unowned `Property`, `player.canAfford(price)` is `true`
  - **Expected**: `propertyPromptView.showProperty(property, player)` is shown and buy/decline
    listeners are registered; no money moves yet
- **TC74: resolveLanding_WhenBuyListenerRuns_PurchasesPropertyAndRefreshes** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State**: current tile is an unowned affordable `Property`; the registered buy listener is invoked
  - **Expected**: `OFFER_PURCHASE` is handled, the property purchase is attempted, and views are refreshed
- **TC75: resolveLanding_WhenDeclineListenerRuns_RefreshesWithoutPurchase** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State**: current tile is an unowned affordable `Property`; the registered decline listener is invoked
  - **Expected**: `NONE` is handled, no purchase is attempted, and views are refreshed
- **TC47: resolveLanding_OnUnownedUnaffordableProperty_RefreshesWithoutPrompt** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State**: current tile is an unowned `Property`, `player.canAfford(price)` is `false`
  - **Expected**: no prompt is shown; views are refreshed; ownership/balance unchanged
- **TC48: resolveLanding_OnPropertyOwnedByAnother_ChargesRent** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State**: current tile is a `Property` owned by another active player; renter can afford rent
  - **Expected**: rent is charged via `PropertyController.handleRentPayment`; views refreshed
- **TC49: resolveLanding_OnPropertyOwnedBySelf_RefreshesOnly** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State**: current tile is a `Property` owned by the current player
  - **Expected**: no payment/prompt; views refreshed
- **TC50: resolveLanding_OnIrsTile_PaysTax** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State**: current tile is an `IRSTile`; player can afford the tax
  - **Expected**: `PAY_TAX` of `Constants.GO_BONUS` is applied; views refreshed
- **TC51: resolveLanding_OnChanceTile_DrawsAndShowsCard** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State**: current tile is a `ChanceTile`
  - **Expected**: `CardController.drawChanceCard(player)` is drawn and `cardView` displays it; effect
    is not applied until Proceed
- **TC52: resolveLanding_OnGoToJailTile_SendsToJail** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State**: current tile is a `GoToJailTile`
  - **Expected**: `JailController.sendToJail(player)` is called; views refreshed

  - **State**: current tile is `JailTile` (just visiting) or `FreeParking`
  - **Expected**: no payment/prompt; views refreshed

### Method under test: `playTurn()`

Owns one full turn: jail handling, roll, move, GO-pass bonus, then `resolveLanding()`.

1. Input: current game state, Output: a fully resolved turn
2. Input type: bankrupt/jailed flags, dice total, pass-GO boundary
3. Input boundary values: bankrupt current player, jailed current player, passes GO, lands on GO,
   lands elsewhere

- **TC54: playTurn_WhenCurrentPlayerBankrupt_DoesNothing** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State**: `currentPlayer.isBankrupt()` is `true`
  - **Expected**: no roll/move; returns without changing state
- **TC55: playTurn_WhenNotInJail_RollsMovesAndResolves** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State**: active, not in jail; controlled dice total
  - **Expected**: `dice.roll()`, `diceView.showRollResult`, `gameEngine.movePlayer`, then landing is
    resolved
- **TC56: playTurn_WhenPassesGoWithoutLanding_GrantsGoBonus** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State**: move wraps past GO and lands on a non-GO tile (`didPassGo` true)
  - **Expected**: `COLLECT_MONEY` of `Constants.GO_BONUS` is granted exactly once (no double with a
    GO landing)

#### Jail turn (a jailed player's `playTurn`)

When the current player starts their turn in jail, the controller attempts to roll doubles; if that
fails and the player has reached `MAX_JAIL_TURNS`, the jail fee is auto-paid so play can continue.

- **TC61: playTurn_WhenInJailAndRollsDoubles_LeavesJail** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State**: current player is in jail; `JailController.attemptRollDoubles` returns `true`
  - **Expected**: no board move; views refreshed

  - **State**: in jail, `attemptRollDoubles` false, `getJailTurnCount` below `MAX_JAIL_TURNS`
  - **Expected**: no fee paid; views refreshed (player remains jailed)
- **TC63: playTurn_WhenInJailNoDoublesAtMaxTurns_PaysFee** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State**: in jail, `attemptRollDoubles` false, `getJailTurnCount` equals `MAX_JAIL_TURNS`
  - **Expected**: `JailController.payJailFee` is invoked; views refreshed

- **TC57: handleTileAction_WithPayRentAffordable_TransfersRent** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State**: `PAY_RENT` action, renter can afford rent

  - **State**: `GO_TO_JAIL` action
  - **Expected**: `JailController.sendToJail(player)`; views refreshed
- **TC68: handleTileAction_WithUnhandledMovePlayerAction_DoesNothing** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State**: `MOVE_PLAYER` action reaches `GameController.handleTileAction`
  - **Expected**: no controller-side effect occurs; no views are refreshed because movement is handled
    through `playTurn` / `GameEngine.movePlayer`
- **TC69: handleTileAction_WithPayRentOnNonProperty_RefreshesOnly** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State**: `PAY_RENT` action is supplied with a tile that is not a `Property`
  - **Expected**: rent payment is rejected; views are refreshed; no player is eliminated

### Forced sale + elimination (rent / tax shortfall)

When a required payment exceeds the player's cash, the controller first forces property sales
(`PropertyController.handleForcedSale`, 80% resale) and only eliminates the player if that still
isn't enough.

- **TC64: resolveLanding_OnRentShortfallForcedSaleCovers_PaysRent** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State**: renter can't afford rent, but `handleForcedSale` raises enough; second
    `handleRentPayment` succeeds

- **TC71: resolveLanding_OnTaxForcedSaleThenRemoveFails_EliminatesPlayer** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State**: player initially cannot pay IRS tax; forced sale succeeds, but the second `remove`
    still fails
  - **Expected**: player is eliminated after the failed post-sale tax attempt; views are refreshed
- **TC72: resolveLanding_OnRentShortfallWithoutBankruptcyView_EliminatesPlayer** ( :white_check_mark: )
  - **State**: renter cannot pay rent and no `BankruptcyView` collaborator has been injected
