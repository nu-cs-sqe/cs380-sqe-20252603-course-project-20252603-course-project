- Input #1: source square
- Input #2: board state
- Output #1: set of candidate destination squares
- Output #2: exception

### Step 2 - Data Types
- Input #1: Reference
- Input #2: Reference
- Output #1: Collection
- Output #2: Case

### Step 3 - Concrete Values
- Source square: center square (3, 3), corner square (0, 0), edge square (0, 3), null
- Board state: empty board, friendly piece on adjacent square, opponent piece on
  adjacent square, null
- Output: all adjacent squares from the center, friendly-occupied square excluded,
  opponent-occupied square included

### Step 4 - Test Cases
- **TC2: center square has eight candidate moves** ( ✅ )
	- **State of the system**: white king at (3, 3), otherwise empty board
	- **Expected output**: candidate moves are the eight adjacent squares around (3, 3)

- **TC3: corner square has three candidate moves** ( ✅ )
	- **State of the system**: white king at (0, 0), otherwise empty board
	- **Expected output**: candidate moves are (0, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 1)

- **TC4: edge square has five candidate moves** ( ✅ )
	- **State of the system**: white king at (0, 3), otherwise empty board
	- **Expected output**: candidate moves are the five adjacent squares that remain on the board

- **TC5: friendly piece blocks adjacent destination** ( ✅ )
	- **State of the system**: white king at (3, 3), white pawn at (4, 4)
	- **Expected output**: (4, 4) is not included; the other seven center moves remain

- **TC6: opponent piece on adjacent square can be captured** ( ✅ )
	- **State of the system**: white king at (3, 3), black pawn at (4, 4)
	- **Expected output**: (4, 4) is included with the other center moves

- **TC7: null source square is rejected** ( ✅ )
	- **State of the system**: source square = null, board = empty board
	- **Expected output**: exception

- **TC8: null board is rejected** ( ✅ )
	- **State of the system**: source square = (3, 3), board = null
	- **Expected output**: exception
