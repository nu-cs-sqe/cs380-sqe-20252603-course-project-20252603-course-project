## User Story: Start and Play a Custom Monopoly Game

As a player of our custom Monopoly game, I want the game to automatically set up a 9x9 board, initialize 2–4 players, handle turns, property purchases, taxes, chance cards, jail, and player elimination, so that players can play a complete Monopoly-style game without manually managing the rules or board state.
