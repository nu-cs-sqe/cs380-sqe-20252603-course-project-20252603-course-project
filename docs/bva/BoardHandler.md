### BVA for BoardHandler Class

'BoardHandler' is responsible for updating hexes and the board graph when players place a settlement, city, or a road. 
It will also calculate the longest road and handle the robber.

### Method under test: `buildSettlement(Player player, int nodeId)`

Step 1:
- Input: Player
- Input: nodeId
- Input: State of the board
- Output: State of the board
- Output: State of the hexes
- Output: Error

Step 2:
- Input - Player class
- Input - Interval
- Input - Cases
- Output - Cases
- Output - Cases
- Output - Exception

Step 3:
- Input: RED, BLUE, ORANGE, WHITE
- Input: 0, 53, -1, 54
- Input: Node is adjacent to 1, 2, or 3 hexes
- Output: Node now occupied, node not occupied, node still occupied by other player (was already occupied) 
- Output: Hexes have player in list of settlements, hex player list not updated - For integration testing, not unit testable
- Output: "Invalid NodeID - must be within [0, 53]."

- Input: Node is adjacent to 1, 2, or 3 hexes
- Output: Node occupied, node not occupied, node still occupied by other player (was already occupied by other player) 
  - Note: Needed for cities, but not settlements, as claiming a node in BoardGraph already handles already owning a node, but isn't called here
- Output: Hex has player in list of cities, hex player list not updated - For integration testing, not unit testable
- Output: Player cities list updated or not (Other validation completed by Player BVA testing)
- Output: "Out of bounds nodeId", "Must upgrade a settlement to a city."

### Method under test: `computeResourceDemand(int rollNum)`

Iterates all 19 hexes; a hex contributes when: `hex.rollNum == rollNum` AND `hex.id != robberLocation` AND `hex.resource != DESERT`. Settlements contribute 1 per player; cities contribute 2 per player. Players on multiple contributing hexes with the same resource have their amounts summed.

Step 1:

- Input: rollNum (the die value to match against hexes)
- Input: Robber location (blocks a matching hex entirely)
- Input: Settlement and city player lists on each hex
- Output: `Map<Resource, Map<Player, Integer>>` — demand per resource per player

Step 2:

- rollNum: Interval [2, 12]; matches or does not match each hex's rollNum
- Robber: Cases {on a matching hex (blocks it), not on any matching hex}
- Hex resource: Cases {DESERT (skipped), non-DESERT (included)}
- Settlement list per hex: Collection {empty, one player, multiple players}
- City list per hex: Collection {empty, one player}
- Same player on multiple matching hexes with same resource: amounts are summed

Step 3:

- rollNum: 2 (min valid), 12 (max valid); value that matches multiple hexes (e.g. 8 matches hex 11 ORE and hex 12 LUMBER)
- Robber: on the only matching hex; on one of two matching hexes; not on any matching hex
- Settlement: none on hex; 1 player; same player on 2 matching hexes same resource
- City: 1 player on hex (produces 2 instead of 1)
- No hexes match rollNum → empty result

### Method under test: `getAvailablePorts(Player player)`

Step 1:
- Input: Player
- Input: Ports
- Input: State of the board
- Output: List of available ports

Step 2:
- Input - Cases
- Input - Collection
- Input - Cases
- Output - Collection

Step 3:
- Input: RED, ORANGE, BLUE, WHITE 
- Input: Collection - Will always be list of 9 created ports
- Input: Player owns nodes next to number of ports
- Output: empty collection, contains just one element, contains more than one element, duplicate elements (not feasible), max possible size (7)
