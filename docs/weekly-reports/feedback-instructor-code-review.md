# Instructor Code Review Feedback

**Contact**: Dr. Yiji Zhang (yiji.zhang@northwestern.edu)

**Purpose of This Document**:
The instructor will perform code review with respect to software design, error handling, format and style on the main branch every week starting Week 6 using the letter grade A standards.
The following chapters of the textbook are considered: Chapter 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10. The corresponding lectures are considered, too.

Please note that this feedback does not include evaluation of your progress, the proper use of linters, the quality of your test cases, or your compliance of TDD/BDD workflow.  
You can find the weekly feedback from your dedicated PM/TA for that.

## Week 10 Feedback
The following table contains the _Grading Rubrics for the Team_ that was released on Canvas in the beginning of the quarter (Canvas -> Project Resources -> Grading).
The instructor reviewed all the code in your main branch against every rubric item except "Product Completion."
If any item is not satisfied, your grade will not be penalized as long as your team corrects it between now and the final submission.

Note that the instructor may have granted some teams specific exceptions, which are not reflected in this feedback.
So don't worry if an item is marked "significant issue found" but you've been granted an exception for it.
Just make sure to document that exception in your README.md when you finalize your submission.

After this feedback, make sure any new code you add continues to satisfy the rubric items.

*How to read the rubrics: The evaluation starts with the criteria for F and progresses through D, C, B, and A. The grade advances to the next level if all criteria for the current grade are met or exceeded.*

Status:
- ✅: The rubric item is met or exceeded!
- ⚠️: Attention needed
- ❌: Significant issue found
- ➖: Not evaluated by the instructor in this feedback

### Other comments
The commit history is so beautiful --- good job!! Can't wait to see the final product!

## Week 7-8 Code Review
This review is for the code your team developed in Week 7 and 8.
I apologize for this delayed code review (should have been given last Friday but I got really sick...).
As compensation, I will add one extra code review in Week 10 (around Thursday).

Doesn't seem there is a lot of new code compared to last time. I will do one more next week. Hopefully you have more code in the `main` branch so I can give some code review feedback before I assign you the final grade.

You got this :)!!

## Week 6 Code Review
I have read every line of production code currently in the main branch.
The Action interface, Card and CardType classes should go into the domain package. 

Look forward to reviewing more of your domain logic in the next review.

Please approve and merge the PR once the team has read the feedback. Thanks!
