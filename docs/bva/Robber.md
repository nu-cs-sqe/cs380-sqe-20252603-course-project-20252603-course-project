### Method under test: `moveRobber(int HexId)`

Step 1:
- Input: HexId
- Output: Robber state
- Output: Invalid HexId

Step 2:
- HexId - Interval
- State - Robber location, interval
- Error - exception

Step 3:
- Input: MIN_HEX_ID (0), MAX_HEX_ID (18), -1, 19
- Output: IN_HEX_ID (0), MAX_HEX_ID (18), -1 (not feasible), 19 (not feasible)
- Output: "Cannot move Robber to invalid HexId"

|             | System under test     | Expected output                       | Implemented?       |
|-------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Test Case 1 | Move robber to hex 0  | Robber location is at 0               | :white_check_mark: |
| Test Case 2 | Move robber to hex 18 | Robber location is at 18              | :white_check_mark: |
| Test Case 3 | Move robber to hex -1 | "Cannot move Robber to invalid HexId" | :white_check_mark: |
| Test Case 4 | Move robber to hex 19 | "Cannot move Robber to invalid HexId" | :white_check_mark: |

Step 1:
- Output: Robber location, as hexId

Step 2:
- HexId - Interval

Step 3:
- Output: IN_HEX_ID (0), MAX_HEX_ID (18), -1 (not feasible), 19 (not feasible)
