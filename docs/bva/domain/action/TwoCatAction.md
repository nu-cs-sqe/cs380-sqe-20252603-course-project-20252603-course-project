# BVA Analysis for TwoCatAction

## Public interface for this class
- execute(gameState) → void

## Assumptions and notes
- PlayerInteractionHelper.stealRandomCard handles the random card theft.
- Current player picks a target via PlayerInteractionHelper.pickTarget.
- If no other active players exist, an IllegalStateException is thrown.
- If the target has an empty hand, no card is stolen (handled by stealRandomCard).



### Method under test: `execute()`
spaces: number of other active players, target hand size

cases:
- no other active players: IllegalStateException
- target has 0 cards: no card stolen
- target has 1 card: that card stolen
- target has many cards: one random card stolen
- max size (N/A)
